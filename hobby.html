	<h1>MY HOBBY</h1>

	<p><img src="image/hobby1.jpg" height="250px" width="300px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 50px"><img src="image/hobby2.jpg" height="230px" width="350px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:50px 0px"></p>

	<p> Painting is an amazing hobby for me because it allows me to create everything I can imagine, and it also provides me with an indirect means of expressing my innermost thoughts and feelings.</p> 

	<p>One of the best things one can learn from painting is patience, and I learned a lot about it as well. To create a work of art or develop a signature method of operation requires time and effort. Even though it can be frustrating at times, I've found that my drawings always turn out better in the end if I stick with them and take my time.</p>
